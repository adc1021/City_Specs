# City Specs

Welcome to the City Specs ReadMe!

City Specs is a fun little data visualization project to give users a little more information about different cities across the USA. 
Users can toggle through a list of cities to see where each location stacks up across 6 different metrics. All data for the polar graph is pulled from
the Teleport API. Additional information is provided in the form of markers on a map built using the Maps JavaScript API. 

## Functionality & MVPs:
- Choose from a number of cities in the select drop down to get a range of metrics from education to crime
- click the `More Info` button to access the map displaying the location of the homes that are plotted on the bar graph
- a single click will zoom towards the selected marker
- a double click on the same marker will display an image of each home

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
