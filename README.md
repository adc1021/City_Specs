# City Specs

Welcome to the City Specs ReadMe!

City Specs is a fun little data visualization project to give users a little more information about different cities across the USA. 
Users can toggle through a list of cities to see where each location stacks up across 6 different metrics. All data for the polar graph is pulled from
the Teleport API. Additional information is provided in the form of markers on a map built using the Maps JavaScript API
